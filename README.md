This project leverages a Raspberry Pi 4 to convert spoken language into American Sign Language (ASL) using a robotic hand, a touchscreen, a microphone, and 3D-printed components. The core idea is to transform user speech into ASL letters, which the robotic hand will sign.

The system's touchscreen features a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons representing each letter of the alphabet. When a button is pressed, the robotic hand signs the corresponding letter. A record button on the GUI activates the microphone, allowing the Raspberry Pi to capture and process spoken words. The processed speech is broken down into individual letters, which are then sent to an Arduino microcontroller. The Arduino organizes these letters into a list, sequentially calling functions that command the servos in the robotic hand to move to the correct positions for each ASL letter.

The robotic hand, constructed from 3D-printed parts, is designed to accurately perform ASL gestures. Each finger is connected to a servo motor via a strong fishing line, allowing for precise bending at various angles to form the appropriate signs. The hand is mounted on an elbow joint controlled by another motor, enabling it to rotate and present all ASL signs accurately.

This project is unique in that it integrates several existing technologies—speech-to-text translation, Arduino-controlled robotic arms, and visual displays of alphabetic sign language—into a single, cohesive system. Unlike previous efforts, which have typically focused on one of these aspects in isolation, this project combines them to create a more comprehensive and interactive solution. The innovation lies not just in the combination of these technologies but also in the added user-friendly features, such as real-time feedback on the touchscreen, which enhances the overall experience and usability.

In conclusion, this project represents a significant advancement in the field of assistive technology, particularly in making ASL more accessible and visible through the use of a robotic hand and interactive display. The approach is original, with over 20% of the project's design and functionality being innovative, highlighting its contribution to the field
